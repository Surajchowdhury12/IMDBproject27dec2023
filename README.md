#About Project
/--------------------------------------------------------/
<p>This project is an IMDB clone app built using vanilla JavaScript and the OMDB API. It has two pages - the Home Page and the Movie Page.

Home Page:
The Home Page has a search bar where users can search for movies using the OMDB API. As the user types, the search results are updated dynamically, just like Google search suggestions. Each search result displays the movie title, year of release, and a "Add to Favorites" button. Clicking on the "Add to Favorites" button adds the movie to the user's favorites list.

Movie Page:
Clicking on a particular search result (movie) opens a new page with more information about that movie. The Movie Page displays the movie poster, title, year of release, plot, and other details (if available) using data fetched from the OMDB API.

The project uses the fetch API to make API requests to the OMDB API and get data about movies. It also uses event listeners to handle user interactions such as searching for movies, adding movies to favorites, and clicking on a search result to view movie details.

Problem statement
<p>
Create a mini IMDB clone app. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).
</p>
<p>
Instructions
Use the OMDB API: https://www.omdbapi.com/
You are ALLOWED to style the app any way you like.
You are ALLOWED to google and read how to approach the problem.
DO NOT copy and paste code from the internet.
DO NOT cheat with other students. REMEMBER: These tests are for YOU so that you can learn something new. Cheating won’t help. It’s better to not submit the solution than to cheat and submit. PS: There will be a plagiarism check and when found cheating, you won’t be allowed to give future tests.
Once you have finished with the test, make a video recording your computer screen (via phone or a software like OBS/screencastify etc) and explaining how you have approached the problem in code and showing the final product. The video can be UPTO 5 mins long. Please don’t record videos longer than that.
Upload and Host the code on github as well.
Once you have recorded the video, upload it on youtube (unlisted or whatever), drive or wherever you want to upload it.
Hosting on Github is compulsory, I will be rejecting the submission if not hosted!


Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features)
Home Page
Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
Each search result of the movie should have a favourite button, clicking on which the movie should be added to “My favourite movies” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page)

Movie Page
Should show information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

My favourite movies Page
Display a list of all the favourite movies.
Make this list persistent (should have the same number of movies before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
Remove from favourites button: Each movie should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that movie from the list.
